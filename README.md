## Purpose

This package allows users to benefit from various types of ballistic models, with an emphasis on vulcanology and geology applications. This repository is intended as reference for an accompanying publication.

## Current version notes

* Presently, the model implementing the Stokes equations (numerical proportional to velocity with gravity) is in beta testing, and a complete version will be released by mid-July.
